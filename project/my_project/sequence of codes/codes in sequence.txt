django/shell installation and URL creation

django-admin startproject <project_name>
python manage.py runserver
crtl+c <- to stop the server

django-admin startapp <app_name>
#register app
1. open apps.py file from appfolder copy 'classname' and 
2. go to settings file in project and paste under installed apps 
3. saying it is in app 'blog' and file 'apps' and paste the class
eg:  blog.apps.BlogConfig

Run the server after changes to see if you have any errors using -python manage.py runserver

MVT Architecture
Model - Database
View - displaying data
Template - 


Working on views
1. Open views in app 
2. define a function
3. To use html code import http response using "from django.http import HttpResponse"

Working on url
1. create a new file called url under app
2. copy paste url package that is alreay present in project url.py file
3. Add from . import views package to display things present in views.py
if you run the server now you get error saying the url of project is not correct
4. so include 'blog.urls.py' path in project url file

#working on template

So here we have a directory which contains html,css and javascript files. We need to integrate into code.
1. Create a folder called 'templates' under the blog app
2. Within templates to organize files create a folder called 'blogs' where we create some html files.
3. So we create a foldername.htmlextension and type '<ht + tab' we automatically get the whole code. And add required html code.
